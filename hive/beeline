Step1) beeline

Step2) !connect jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000/dardb


!connect jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000/default


1. beeline -u "jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000" -n username
> beeline should prompt for the password.
2. beeline -u "jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000" -n username -p <password is expected because -p is provided>
If we can achieve (1) above within beeline, I think that should be sufficient to solve this issue without any work-arounds mentioned by Thejas M Nair in the first comment.
